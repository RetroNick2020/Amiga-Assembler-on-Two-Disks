# Amiga-Assembler-on-Two-Disks
Project for translating Fabio Ciuccis assembler-course for the Amiga from 1994, from Italian to English.

Original text is in Italian, published under the name "Corso Completo di programmazione assembler in due dischi", 2016, under the GNU License v1.3

Main author: Fabio Ciucci

Contributors: Alessandro Sperind√©, Stefanio Calcagno

Translators:
Google Translate, Roger Bratseth

I have chosen to generate ASCII-files that can be used in the Amiga-environment, using Notepad++ with these settings:
- Format: UTF-8 (without Byte Order Mark, BOM)
- End Of Line-convention: Unix (LF)
- TAB-size: 8
- And adjusting the width of the Notedpad++-window to get a wordwrap around column 79, for placing LF in the right place.

This is an on-going process. Parts of the translating tasks can be automated, but one still need to verify that the text makes sense.
Feel free to join. I am currently working on lesson 3, 4, 5 and 9.
