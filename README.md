I have chosen to generate ASCII-files that can be used in the Amiga-environment, using Notepad++ with these settings:
- Format: UTF-8 (without Byte Order Mark, BOM)
- End Of Line-convention: Unix (LF)
- TAB-size: 8
- And adjusting the width of the Notedpad++-window to get a wordwrap around column 79, for placing LF in the right place.
