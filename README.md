# Amiga-Assembler-on-Two-Disks
Project for translating Fabio Ciuccis amazing assembler-course for the Amiga from 1994, from Italian to English.

I think it is quite unique in that it in addition to classic Amigas also covers 68020+ and AGA Amigas, focusing on demo and game development, while at the same time making sure the code can run from harddisk, CD-ROM and CD32, with any memory configuration.

Original text is in Italian, published under the name "Corso Completo di programmazione assembler in due dischi", 2016, under the GNU License v1.3

I have focused on making sure the translation from Google makes sense. I'm fully aware of the fact that it is not perfect English. Feel free to improve! The original content really deserves better English. But I feel it is more important to make Fabio's amazing Amiga-knowledge available to a bigger community.

I have chosen to generate ASCII-files that can be used in the Amiga-environment, using Notepad++ with these settings:
- Format: UTF-8 (without Byte Order Mark, BOM)
- End Of Line-convention: Unix (LF)
- TAB-size: 8
- And adjusting the width of the Notedpad++-window to get a wordwrap around column 79, for placing LF in the right place.

This is an on-going process. Parts of the translating tasks can be automated (I'm using some simple AutoHotkey scripts), but one still need to verify that the text makes sense.
Feel free to join. I am currently working on lesson 12. Some source-files are translated, but this is tedious work, will finish the lessons first. But the sources will in many cases contain material not covered in the lessons.
