; This routine slides the 14 colors of our green copperlist in order to
; simulate a continuous upward sliding, as if we saw an unlimited series of
; faded bars through a crack. In practice, each time you move the colors by
; copying them, starting copying the second to the first, the third to the
; second, etc., as if we had a row of colored balls in series: suppose you
; take the second and put it in place of the first, which you put in
; pocket, creating a "hole": you will continue moving all the balls one to
; one of a place: the third in place of the second, the fourth in place
; of the third, and so on, until you reach the fourteenth (the last ) that
; moved where the thirteenth was, creating the "hole" that was previously
; in place of the first.
; To plug this hole take the first ball from the pocket and put it in place
; of the fourteenth (note the last statement that in fact is "move.w col1,
; col14", ie after having "scratched" the "hole" from the first position at
; the fourteenth, we "tap" it with the first ball, creating a cycle of
; continuity (infinity!) as the sliding of the bicycle chain:
;
;	 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>	
;	^                     v
;	 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
;
; but without the lower part of the chain: simply when a link in the chain (a
; color) arrives at the end (v), it is copied to the first position (^),
; making the infinite loop possible:
;
;	 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>	
;	^		      v
;
; In fact, to stop the routine just delete any of the instructions that copy:
; try for example to put a ";" to the first one: (move.w col2, col1) and you
; will verify that it will only write once, after which the colors will end,
; being "BROKEN A RING OF THE CHAIN", which no longer provides the previous
; color.

	END

Modification: Try adding this command to the end of the "Scrollcolors" routine,
and you will get a change of colors (add 1 to the RED component, ie RED)

	add.w   #$100,col13

Try then to change the value that we add to col13, to get different color
variations. Clearly it is a somewhat approximate system to make nuances, but
it can be useful for making sure you understand the routine.
